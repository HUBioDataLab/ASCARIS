To run Ml-based analysis, please download the file [ASCARIS_ML-based-VEP_scripts_files.zip]() to the the main (root) folder of the repo and uncompress it (so all the files and folers in the compressed file should be placed this folder). cd into this folder (i.e., ASCARIS_ML-based-VEP_scripts_files) and run the scripts in the given order (please follow the guideline presented as comments in some of the scripts):

1) VEP_ML_modeling.m
2) VEP_ML_modeling_benchmark_MT.m
3) VEP_ML_modeling_benchmark_predictSNP.m
4) VEP_ML_modeling_benchmark_SwissVar.m
5) VEP_ML_modeling_benchmark_VariBench.m
6) DMS_benchmark_modeling/VEP_ML_modeling_benchmark_DMS.m
7) AlphaFold_analysis/VEP_ML_modeling_alphafold.m
8) AlphaFold_analysis/VEP_ML_modeling_benchmark_MT_alphafold.m
9) AlphaFold_analysis/VEP_ML_modeling_benchmark_predictSNP_alphafold.m
10) AlphaFold_analysis/VEP_ML_modeling_benchmark_SwissVar_alphafold.m
11) AlphaFold_analysis/VEP_ML_modeling_benchmark_VariBench_alphafold.m
12) DMS_benchmark_modeling/VEP_ML_modeling_benchmark_DMS_AlphaFold.m

Some of the scripts presented in the compressed file are also given here in the repo, you can just overwrite them during the uncompression process as they are exactly the same.
